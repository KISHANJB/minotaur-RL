/**
 * NodeRelaxer class is used to create relaxations for nodes in a tree.
 * The relaxation at a node can be created in different ways, depending upon
 * the problem and the algorithm used. For instance, in NLP-BB, we can
 * simply relax the integrality constraints. In this case, we can just keep
 * one copy of the relaxation and change bounds in different nodes. For LP
 * based branch-and-reduce, the relaxation could be very different in a
 * node, and we may want to create new relaxation in every node.
 * 
 * Relaxations are created using handlers. Therefore, the NodeRelaxer must
 * have compatible handlers. For instance, we can not have a handler return
 * cuts in NLP-BB. Also, we can not have handler branch on a new variable
 * created in a relaxation, if we are creating in each node, new relaxations
 * from scratch.
 * 
 * This is the abstract base class.
