Here is an example of calling Minotaur from a fortran code. Fortran code calls
a C++ function, that creates a convex MINLP (from scratch, without using AMPL)
and solves it using branch-and-bound with filter-sqp.

The problem that needs to be solved is

min \sum_i a_ix_i^{b_i}
s.t. \sum_i x_i = N
     x_i integer

Fortran code supplies arrays a_i, b_i and constant N.

Compiles on a Blue-Gene Q!
