1. multiple sub-problems
   - [ ] form the large problem efficiently
   - [x] using MPI to handle multiple sub-problems

2. form the large problem based on the power transmission network expansion
   planning and test the code on fusion cluster

3. add some code to check if the optimum has reached. 

4. using the Branch-and-bound methods from minotaur to deal with the case that
   the decision variables are integer or binary
